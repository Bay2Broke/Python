Scrabble Helper
======

For any given list of tiles, finds anagrams that can but do not necessarily use all tiles, and sorts them by their scrabble value, which it also lists. Includes two scrabble dictionary text files (USA uses OSPD while GB primarily uses SOWPODS.) The programs use OSPD, but can  be easily modified to use SOWPODS. Includes one program that simply prints the scrabble dictionary to the shell, one text based word finder, and one with a GUI.
